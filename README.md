# Burger 2: The Sequel

### Overview

In this assignment, I'm going to Sequelize the `Burger` app that made in the last unit. As this assynment will replace the usage of the regular MySQL to the `Sequelize` npm package which is an ORM oriented library and gives the ease to the developer for any more integration. This assignment is solved to the third challenge tier.
